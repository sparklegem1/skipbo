# skipbo
Play the Skip-Bo card game right in your terminal. Choose the amount of cards in your pile and you are ready to play. Type the number of the card you wish to play, 
or type "skip-bo" to play you skip-bo (wild) card and select its value. You may also play from your discard pile by typing "dis", or play your top card by typing
"top". If you are finished with your turn, just type "done" and it will take you through the steps of discarding from your hand. The game ends when your pile runs
out. Thanks for playing!
